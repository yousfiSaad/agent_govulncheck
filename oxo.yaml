kind: Agent
name: govulncheck
version: 0.1.0
description: Go vulnerability scanner using govulncheck with smart code analysis. This agent accepts go.mod/go.sum file paths as entry points but scans the entire Go module directory to analyze if vulnerable code is actually used. This reduces false positives compared to the OSV agent by only reporting vulnerabilities that are reachable in the codebase.
